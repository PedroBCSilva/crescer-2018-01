                <span class="bigStrong">H</span>ypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
                With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.

                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
                With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
                HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
                HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class="tagsHTML"><span><</span>img /></span> and <span class="tagsHTML"><span><</span>input /></span> directly introduce content into the page.
                Other tags such as <span class="tagsHTML"><span><</span>p></span> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page
          </p>
          <p class="texto-identado">
                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
                Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and
                the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

                In 1980, physicist <u>Tim Berners-Lee</u>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
                In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser
                and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request
                for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas
                in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

                    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by
                    Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.
                     Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
                      (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.
